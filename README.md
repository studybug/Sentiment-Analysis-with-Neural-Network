# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Neural-Network

In this project, I build my own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. This model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, I will be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
